<h2>My favorite part of advenced web</h2>
I would have to say my favorite part of being at patino
is feeling apart from other schools. The liberties we have 
here are very different from other schools which i think 
is pretty great. also my friends and teachers at patino are 
amazing and i cant picture going through everyday with out them. 
<h2>My least favorite part of advanced web developement</h2>
Lor Chosing 3 things is hard because whats not to like. I think
for me one thing i dont like is constantly being behind only because
i dont understand the material a lot of the times. Another thing would 
be staring at the screen all day but i guess thats web developement for ya.
